The idea is to provide a reusable menu widget that applications can plug into their menu bar in debug builds.  


## Actions

The widget would have pre-defines actions. 

* dump pipeline graph 
* dump pipeline graph and show 
* dump details 
      * caps 
      * ... 
* --- 
* category log levels 
      * gstreamer 
            * GST_XXX 
                  * WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, LOG 
      * application 
            * <name> 
                  * WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, LOG 

## API

The menu widget has some extra properties: 

   * [[GstPipeline|GstPipeline]] *pipleine 
   * gchar *debug-categories (as ',' separated list of names)
