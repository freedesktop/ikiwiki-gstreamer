# Finishing/Improving the GStreamer C#/CLI bindings

3 years ago the GStreamer C#/CLI bindings were started as a GSoC project. Unfortunately they didn't reach a releaseable and usable state and nobody worked on it afterwards. This GSoC project is about finishing/improving these bindings. There are still some fundamental issues and a lot of functionality is not included yet. 

Useful skills for this project would be general knowledge about GStreamer and C#, even better would be knowledge about C# bindings in general and GObject-based C# bindings in specific.
