# Create more baseclases


## Background

One major improvment of the 0.10 series was the use of baseclasses. All plugins were derived directly from [[GstElement|GstElement]] in the 0.8 series. In 0.10 there are still several use cases where base classes would be beneficial. The task consist of studying existing elements and refactoring common functionality into a baseclass. Ideally unit tests are written along to ensure the implementation is correct. 

* [[GstBaseParse|GstBaseParse]]: parser base class 
* [[GstBaseDemux|GstBaseDemux]]: demuxer base class 
* [[GstBaseDecode|GstBaseDecode]]: decoder base class 
* [[GstBaseMux|GstBaseMux]]: muxer base class 
* [[GstBaseEncode|GstBaseEncode]]: encoder base class 
* [[GstTagMux|GstTagMux]]: tag muxer base class
